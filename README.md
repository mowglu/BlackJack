# BlackJack
This is my second Python 3 project. It is a game of BlackJack with visuals!
The Excel file was used to test visuals for the cards when they are displayed on the console.
RUN THIS CODE ON YOUR COMMAND PROMPT OR TERMINAL. Running this in an IDE may not give the intended visual effect.

This is a test update
